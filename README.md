Healthcare, wearables, IoT and privacy are becoming more apparent in our everyday life and we walk around generating tons of data the companies like apple, fitbit and other manufactures or service providers collect and analyze. More and more people start to loose control over their generated data why the European Union is trying to impose more control in their citizens' favor with the newly released General Data Protection Regulation. This regulation is the most important change over data privacy in decades and many companies already released updated terms of use updating their privacy sections spamming us almost with this information.

This report gives an overview of the privacy concerns over health related data generated by commercial wearables, what strategies and approaches there exist and analyzes a particular solution called Pilatus how we could impose privacy protection over this data and still allowing companies to analyze it and improve their services.

The work in progress can be read at https://www.overleaf.com/read/hbncyvrjvzxy, which should be finished in June 15 2018 - I hope ;-).
